# MY CODING PROJECT USING PYTHON

Hello, this is like my own diary where I write down my Python codes that I have studied and solved.
I started coding with Jave first, but I am now into Python. Most of the codes here are based on Python.
I have written simple codes, examples using algorithms, problems dealing with data and problems using machine learning.
If my code here is wrong or there is a better way, please share with me.
Thank you.
