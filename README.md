# MY CODING PROJECT USING PYTHON

Hello, this is like my own diary where I write down my Python codes that I have studied and solved.
Most of the codes here are written in Python.
I have done simple calculation examples, examples using algorithms (such as Brute Force, Dynamic Programming and Divide and Conquer), problems dealing with data and problems using machine learning.
If there is anything that I can improve my codes or there is a better way, please share with me.
Thank you.
