A natural number is called a prime number (or a prime) if it is bigger than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. 
For example, 5 is prime, since no number except 1 and 5 divides it. On the other hand, 6 is not a prime since 6 = 2 Ã— 3 . 
Goldbach's conjecture is one of the famous unsolved problems in number theory and in all of mathematics. 
It states: Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Such a number is called a Goldbach number. 
Expressing a given even number as a sum of two primes is called a Goldbach partition of the number. 
For example, 4 = 2 + 2 , 6 = 3 + 3 , 8 = 3 + 5 , 10 = 7 + 3 or 10 = 5 + 5 , 12 = 5 + 7 , 14 = 3 + 11 or 14 = 7 + 7 . 
Note that Goldbach partition has been found for any even interger n less than 10000.
Given any even integer n greater than 2, write a program that prints the two primes of the Goldbach partition of n . 
If there are more than one Goldbach partitions of n, find a partition such that the difference of the two primes of it is minimized.
